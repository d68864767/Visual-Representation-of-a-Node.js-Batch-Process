# Node.js Batch Processing Visualization

This project provides a visual representation of a Node.js batch processing system. It showcases a modern, streamlined server room environment with multiple server racks, each running Node.js. The system is controlled via a central control panel with an interactive touch screen, showcasing a flowchart of the batch process. The batch process handles large volumes of data, illustrated by streams of data flowing into the system, being processed, and then exiting as organized, structured data.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the structure of the visual representation.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that provides the styling for the visual representation.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file that simulates the batch processing system.
- `server.js`: The Node.js server file that simulates the batch process.
- `data.json`: The JSON file that contains the input data for the batch process.
- `package.json`: The package file that includes the metadata about the app, like its dependencies.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the server.
5. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the visual representation.

## Features

- Multiple server racks with Node.js logos, indicating a distributed processing environment.
- A central control panel with an operator interacting with the system.
- Visual cues like glowing lines and particles to represent data flow and processing activities.
- Subtle background elements like binary code or network diagrams to enhance the technological feel.

## Dependencies

- Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- Body-parser: Node.js body parsing middleware.
- Cors: A Node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.
